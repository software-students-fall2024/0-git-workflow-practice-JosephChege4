# Paragraphs
I'd say the the most interesting thing I found in this article was to learn about how the field of Software Engineering needs to grow and evolve as the years go on. In the fourth section of the article I linked, the author lists Connectivity, Artificial Intelligence, and Security. While initially, these fields' connection to the Software Engineering field felt obvious, it encouraged me to dive deeper into each one and see where Software Engineering can continue to grow. Out of the three, I'd definitely say the security issues sound most important, especially since the author references how vulnerabilities can even affect electoral campaigns.
